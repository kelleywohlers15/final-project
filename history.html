<h1>History of HTML</h1>
<p>HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML. HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating.</p>
<p>HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites.</p>

<h2>History of CSS</h2>
<p>CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.<br>
Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.</p>
<p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets <br>
Before CSS there was very little that could be done to change the design of a web page.</p>

<p>Java is an Object-Oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the early 1990s.<br>
  Gosling and his team did a brainstorm session and after the session, they came up with several names such as JAVA, DNA, SILK, RUBY,.</p>
  <p>The name Java originates from a sort of espresso bean, Java. Gosling came up with this name while having a coffee near his office.</p>
